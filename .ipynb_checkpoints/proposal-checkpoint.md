I was unable to find instructions on how contributions to this software may work, there was no mention in the github page or the detailed documentation website. I know the license is free to use and modify for personal usage, though unsure on updating the package itself. 

I was also unable to find the number of emails per week, I'm not sure if/how that would be publically available information. 

I would also like to verify that there is no automated test suite or contiinous integration, these are new terms to me, and although to the best of my knowledge they're not used here, I could use a second set of eyes.
